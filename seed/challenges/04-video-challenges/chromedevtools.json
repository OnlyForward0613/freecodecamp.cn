        "我们接下来会在每个小节中中使用Free Code Camp用户kmiasko的网站 mckellen.com/ 来做演示。",
        "在chrome浏览器中右击选中'Inspect element'即可访问elements标签，然后你就可以随便修改元素文本，元素标签和任何其他CSS或者HTML。",
        "这些修改不会自动保存，不能当做IDE或者可以保存内容的编辑器。你可以使用chrome中的'persistent authoring'功能去保存更改。",
        "记住这里层叠，继承和其他CSS规则都可以使用，另外，被覆盖的式样会以穿越文字的横线的形式展示。",
        "需要注意的是现在\"树\"中看到的代码是当前的HTML，而不是页面加载时的代码。如果你用JavaScript或Jquery来改变页面元素，\"树\"就会更新。",
        "Padding，border和margin都很容易在右下角的彩色盒子里面检查和编辑。",
